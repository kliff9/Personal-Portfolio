        Hi, I'm Cliff and i am a  Software Developer from USA, Florida. 
        I've always been interested in learning how things work under the hood 
        and building something I can share with others. When I discovered programming, 
        I was excited by all the ideas I could actualize. I started to teach myself 
        how to code and decided that I wanted to turn this hobby into a career path.
